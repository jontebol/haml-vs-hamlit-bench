This was created in order to benchmark some templates with more classes (like with typical Tailwind use), to see which templating gem would be faster for our app.

Here are the results for me locally. Note that I've made changes to the benchmark script (+ templates) which may skew the results, so take this with a big grain of salt until verified by someone who knows these gems better.
